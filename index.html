<p>Snapspot Framework is an upcoming collection of CSS and JavaScript libraries free to use! They make complex tasks like responsive grids and dynamic forms simpler, with some features only needing a few lines of code! The best part about the framework is that it is completely customisable and minimalised. This means that you can pick which module files you want and which ones you don't want. See the 'How to Install' chapter below!</p>
