# Snapspot-Framework
A new, minimal CSS framework built with fast page load times and modularity in mind. A must have framework for any website! This is by no means the fastest CSS framework or the most minimal, but we think that it is a very good medium between minimal and modular.

# Why Snapspot?
There are tons of other CSS frameworks, and I mean **tons**. Most frameworks either have too much content and so people get lost in all of their different modules that they have or expansions that they offer, or that they are not clean and minimal. Snapspot aims to fix both of those problems.

The goal of Snapspot is to create modularity. The way the framework works is simple: You must use the `snapspot.core.css` file if you wish to use any other modules, and then you can just add them in as you please. Let's say that you are looking for a nice, easy-to-use responsive grid for your site. Snapspot has a module called `snapspot.grid.css`. Just include this and the core and then you can start using all of the features from the grid module! Snapspot allows you to speed up your website by removing unnecessary style sheets that you don't want or need.

# Current Speed
Using the Average Load Time Tester chrome extension with Force Refresh Enabled and all Snapspot Modules loaded: `0.095 seconds` for the Load Event to End.

Using the `grid.html` example file.
